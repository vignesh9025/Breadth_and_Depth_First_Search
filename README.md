# Breadth and Depth-First Search

This project demonstrates uninformed search techniques.

---

## About

The following uninformed search methods are demonstrated in this project:

1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
2. Depth-First search (DFS) 

The jupyter notebook implements the following functions:

    breadthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)
    depthFirstSearch(startState, goalState, successorsf)

Each receives as arguments the starting state, the goal state, and a successors function. breadthFirstSearch returns the breadth-first solution path as a list of states starting with the startState and ending with the goalState. depthFirstSearch returns the depth-first solution path. We also implement the same solution using recursive methods.

This project was implemented as a part of the CS440: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Colorado State University, during the Fall of 2017.

### Built With

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Anaconda distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

### Installation

To install, clone the GitHub repo to a local directory:

`git clone https://github.com/vignesh-pagadala/breadth-and-depth-first-search.git`

## Usage

The project can be run either directly or through the Jupyter Notebook, although running in through the Jupyter Notebook might be more convinient. 

For running directly:

1. `cd src/`
2. `python bfs-and-dfs-main.py` 
3. `python bfs-and-dfs-recursion.py`

For running through the Jupyter Notebook:

1. `jupyter-notebook Uninformed-Search-BFS-DFS.ipynb`
